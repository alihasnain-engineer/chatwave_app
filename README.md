Member 1 — Ali Hasnain

I worked mainly on the UI, including the Home Screen and Chat Interface.
I learned how to use Provider for state management and improved my understanding of Flutter layouts.
If I had one more week, I would add Firebase sync and implement message reactions.

Member 2 — Dawood

I handled most of the app logic and helped fix navigation flow from Splash → Login → Home.
I learned how to structure Flutter services and debug common widget errors.
With more time, I would implement profile management and smooth chat animations.

Member 3 — Ahmad Yasin

I worked on integrating the dummy chat data and improving the chat bubbles.
I learned Hero animations and state sharing using Provider.
If given one more week, I would add image sending and push notifications.

Member 4 — Ahmad

I focused on project setup, file structure, assets, and small UI polish.
I learned about proper Git workflow and managing Flutter screens cleanly.
With an extra week, I would refine themes, add dark mode, and better transitions.
